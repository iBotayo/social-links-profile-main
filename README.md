## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I solidify my knowledge on how to structure and position contents in the center using flexbox. With this, I was able to increase my knowledge on flexbox. Also, I used the mobile-first approach in designing.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body {
    background: var(--grey-900);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 22px;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin-top: 20%;
}
```

### Continued development

I would continue to expand my knowledge in flexbox, CSS Grid, mobile-first design approach and also learn to add JavaScript for responsiveness.
